# Snake Game Portfolio - Implementation Summary

## What We Built

A fully functional Snake game navigation system for your portfolio website with the following features:

### üéÆ Core Game Features
- **Classic Snake Gameplay**: Move using Arrow Keys or WASD
- **Portal Navigation**: Navigate to different portfolio sections by moving the snake to colored portals
- **Game Controls**: 
  - Space bar to pause/unpause
  - R key to restart
  - Real-time score tracking
- **Pixel Art Aesthetic**: Retro-styled graphics with smooth animations

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture

#### Game Logic (`src/lib/game/`)
- **constants.js**: Game configuration (grid size, speed, colors, portal definitions)
- **engine.js**: Core game mechanics (movement, direction handling, position utilities)
- **collision.js**: Collision detection (walls, self-collision, portal entry)

#### Components (`src/lib/components/`)
- **Snake.svelte**: Main game orchestrator with Svelte 5 state management
- **GameCanvas.svelte**: Grid-based renderer using CSS Grid
- **Portal.svelte**: Reusable portal info display component

#### Routes
- **/ (Home)**: Main snake game interface
- **/experience**: Work history portal (placeholder)
- **/projects**: Portfolio projects portal (placeholder)
- **/achievements**: Accomplishments portal (placeholder)

### üéØ Portal System

Three portals are currently configured:

1. **Experience Portal** (Blue) - Position: (5, 5)
   - Routes to: `/experience`
   
2. **Projects Portal** (Green) - Position: (24, 5)
   - Routes to: `/projects`
   
3. **Achievements Portal** (Amber) - Position: (15, 14)
   - Routes to: `/achievements`

### üé® Design Features

- **Dark gradient background** with professional styling
- **Pulsing portal animations** for visual appeal
- **Real-time distance tracking** from snake head to each portal
- **Game over overlay** with restart functionality
- **Responsive layout** that works on various screen sizes
- **Pixel-perfect rendering** with `image-rendering: pixelated`

### üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Content Development**: Fill in the portal pages with your actual experience, projects, and achievements
2. **Mobile Controls**: Add touch/swipe controls for mobile devices
3. **Accessibility**: Add a skip-to-content link for users who can't play the game
4. **Additional Features**:
   - Sound effects
   - High score persistence
   - Multiple difficulty levels
   - Food/collectibles system
   - More portals (Contact, Skills, etc.)
5. **Polish**:
   - Add loading states
   - Improve mobile responsiveness
   - Add keyboard shortcut overlay
   - Add meta tags for SEO

### üéì Svelte 5 Patterns Used

- `$state()` for reactive game state
- `$derived.by()` for computed values
- `$props()` for component props
- `$effect()` for side effects and game loop
- `{@render}` for slot content

### üìù Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev       # Start development server
npm run build     # Build for production
npm run preview   # Preview production build
npm run format    # Format code

```

### üéÆ How to Play
